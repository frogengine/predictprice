      This website is price prediction of next day of each stock on Nasdaq based on the financial data of the past.
      I am upgrading the website to include more markets and more frequency of prediction.
      The presentation is based on technologies such as Springboot, Java, JQuery, Hibernate, Mysql, Thymeleaf, Datatables, Bootstrap.
      The prediction of stocks is done based on deep learning.
      The application of neural networks to finance has received much of attention because no assumption
      about a suitable mathematical model has to be made prior to forecasting and they are capable of
      extracting useful information from large sets of data, which is required to describe nonlinear input output relations of financial time series.
      The report presents a model of keras LSTM where 4 layered neural network is trained with financial data and another LSTM model for comparison
      to predict stock price.
